Subject: Evaluate External Perimeter for Risk Vulnerabilities
Date: 


The security team has completed an external perimeter scan of the organization's network. This was accomplished by scanning all subnets with the network scanning tool known as Nmap. With Nmap, the security team identified open ports, exposed services, and service versions for the devices in the network. Service identification was completed using Nmap's fingerprinting feature. The results are enumerated in the table below.

IP AddressPortServiceVersion172.20.241.208000/tcphttpSplunk httpd172.20.241.3022/tcpsshOpenSSH 6.6.1
Nmap's service fingerprinting was unable to identify the service version of every open port from the perimeter. From the service versions that were identified, we ascertained that these servers are vulnerable to certain known exploits in a possible attack on the service.


Vulnerabilities Discovered
For the service ___, we found that the version ___ was vulnerable to exploits that ___ This vulnerability is identified under CVE-_____.

The images below show vulnerabilities found on the ____ machine which is within the organization's current infrastructure. This specific vulnerability show is CVE-____.
