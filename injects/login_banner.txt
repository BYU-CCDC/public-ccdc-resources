Management,


Thank you for expressing your concern regarding our computer systems’ login banners. 


We have taken steps to correct this shortcoming by modifying login banners on our devices so that when someone logs in to access a device they are informed of our company’s acceptable use and security monitoring actions. Due to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, when someone unauthorized accesses one of our devices, they can now be prosecuted for the unauthorized access because they are warned about accessing devices without authorization. 


Previously login banners on our systems looked like this:

Figure 2. Splunk with no initial login banner
                


Our previous login banners provided information about our systems including the operating system in use. Our new login banners reference the company Acceptable Use Policy and emphasize the ability to prosecute misuse or unauthorized access. 


        
New Login Banner:

Windows Devices Login Banner
For Windows devices’ login banners, the message title was set to “Warning” and the message text to “This computer should be used for authorized purposes only. Unauthorized use of this computer will lead to disciplinary action or prosecution.” Whenever a user logs on to a Windows system, this interactive message is displayed. This was applied to all devices on the Windows Domain through a Group Policy. The user can then log in by clicking on the OK button.

Please let us know if there are any additional actions the security team can perform to improve the login banners. 


Thank you,
